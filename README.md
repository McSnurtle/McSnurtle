I am McSnurtle, a hobbyist python programmer with experience in ML, UI, game dev, and networking.
I host several servers in my homelab, and love customizing keyboards. At least I did before I blew up my super tricked out FB60 by running 20V power into the USB C port, literally watching it catch fire :|
